The Remaining Salary still in Beta ()It refreshes only when we restart the app so fix it
Add a remember me check box in the Login Screen with data store
Make the salary type as int and not String (it takes as string and converts to int, change it maybe ?)
Make it so that each transaction are clickable ? And add other feature?
Fetching and Pushing should be done as Suspend Function?
Make the filtering of data happen in the repository and not in the ViewModel for performance
