ReasonRepository work
Work on the Add, delete and update functions in the ReasonRepository
Mke a dropdown which is accesssable from settingsview and addtransactionview
Work on the DeleteReason Functionality


TO BE DONE NOW
Add features like a Dropdown menu for the AddTransaction screen so that the user can select between common things
The user should be able ot select the things he want in the drop down menu from the settings
Add a salary crediting date as well in the settings view


CAN BE DONE LATER
Add a remember me check box in the Login Screen with data store
Make the salary type as int and not String (it takes as string and converts to int, change it maybe ?)
Make it so that each transaction are clickable ? And add other feature?

IDEAS
Use a dummy salary data to display in the homeView card and make a function which reduced the money and updates in the database
In the homeView, below the Big card we can add money spent in Net Banking and cash

UI
Work on all the UI
