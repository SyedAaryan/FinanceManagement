TO BE DONE NOW
Add a salary crediting date as well in the settings view
Add cash and net banking total of the month in the home view
Add others in the DropDownForReason, which opens an input to type others


CAN BE DONE LATER
Add a remember me check box in the Login Screen with data store
Make the salary type as int and not String (it takes as string and converts to int, change it maybe ?)
Make it so that each transaction are clickable ? And add other feature?

IDEAS
Use a dummy salary data to display in the homeView card and make a function which reduced the money and updates in the database
In the homeView, below the Big card we can add money spent in Net Banking and cash

UI
Work on all the UI
